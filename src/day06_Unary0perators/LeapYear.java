2. create a class named LeapYear, and write a program that can identify if the given is Leap Year, print true if it's leap year, otherwise print false
        Ex:
                year = 2020

            output:
                2020 is leap year: true

        Hint: if the number of years can be evenly divisible by 4, it's known as the leap year
